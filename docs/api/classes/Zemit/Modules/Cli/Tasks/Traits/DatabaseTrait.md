## Methods


### mainAction

Default action

```php
public mainAction(): ?array
```











**Throws:**

- [`CliException`](../../../../Exception/CliException.md)



***

### truncateAction

The truncateAction method is responsible for truncating (emptying) database tables specified in the
$this->truncate array. Truncating a table removes all of its data, effectively resetting it to an
empty state. This method iterates through a list of table names and executes an SQL TRUNCATE TABLE
command for each of them.

```php
public truncateAction(): array
```

Use Case:
This method is often used when you need to reset the data in database tables without deleting
the table itself. Truncating tables is a quicker alternative to deleting all rows one by one.










***

### dropAction

The dropAction method is responsible for dropping database tables specified in the $this->drop array.

```php
public dropAction(): array
```

Dropping a table means permanently removing it from the database schema. This method iterates through
a list of table names and executes an SQL DROP TABLE command for each of them, with a safety check to
ensure that the table is only dropped if it exists.

Use Case:
This method is commonly used when performing database schema changes or cleanup tasks, where you need
to remove tables that are no longer needed. The IF EXISTS clause is a safety measure to prevent
accidental deletion of tables.










***

### fixEngineAction

The fixEngineAction method is responsible for fixing or changing the storage engine for database tables
specified in the $this->engine array. A storage engine determines how data is stored and managed within
a database table. This method iterates through a list of table names and their corresponding desired
storage engines and executes SQL ALTER TABLE commands to make the necessary changes.

```php
public fixEngineAction(): array
```

Use Case:
This method is useful when you need to adjust the storage engine of database tables to optimize performance,
compatibility, or for other specific requirements. Different storage engines have different characteristics,
and choosing the right one can impact table performance and functionality.










***

### insertAction

Insert records

```php
public insertAction(?string $models = null): array
```








**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `$models` | **?string** |  |




**Throws:**

- [`CliException`](../../../../Exception/CliException.md)



***

### optimizeAction

The optimizeAction method is responsible for optimizing database tables specified in the
$this->optimize array. Database table optimization is a maintenance task aimed at improving
the performance and storage efficiency of database tables. This method iterates through a
list of table names and executes an SQL OPTIMIZE TABLE command for each of them.

```php
public optimizeAction(): array
```

Use Case:
This method is typically used in the context of database maintenance and optimization routines.
It allows you to automate the process of optimizing database tables, which can help reclaim storage
space and improve query performance by reorganizing table data and indexes.










***

### analyzeAction

This method is responsible for analyzing database tables specified in the $this->analyse array.

```php
public analyzeAction(): array
```

Table analysis is an essential database maintenance task that helps optimize the performance
of database queries. Analyzing a table refreshes statistics and metadata about the table's
structure, which can lead to improved query execution plans.

Use Case:
This method can be used in the context of database optimization and maintenance scripts.
It allows you to automate the process of analyzing database tables, ensuring that the database's
query optimizer has up-to-date statistics to make informed decisions about query execution plans.










***

### addModelsPermissions



```php
public addModelsPermissions(?array $tables = null): void
```








**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `$tables` | **?array** |  |




**Throws:**

- [`Exception`](https://docs.phalcon.io/latest/api/){:target="_blank"}
