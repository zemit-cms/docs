# Dispatcher Component

## Overview

The Dispatcher component in Zemit is a dynamic and essential element that acts as a liaison between the routing layer
and the application's execution logic. Its primary function is to interpret and process requests as directed by the
Router, ensuring each request is handled by the correct module, controller, task, or action, accompanied by relevant
parameters. To cater to different operational environments, Zemit employs two specialized types of dispatchers:

- **`\Zemit\Cli\Dispatcher`**: This dispatcher is specifically designed for handling command-line interfaces (CLI) and
  Server API (SAPI) interactions. It extends the functionality
  of [`\Phalcon\Cli\Dispatcher`](https://docs.phalcon.io/latest/api/phalcon_cli/#clidispatcher){:target="_blank"},
  providing a tailored experience for non-web-based applications.
- **`\Zemit\Mvc\Dispatcher`**: Focused on web-based applications, this dispatcher manages web requests by
  extending [`\Phalcon\Mvc\Dispatcher`](https://docs.phalcon.io/latest/api/phalcon_mvc/#mvcdispatcher){:target="_
  blank"}. It ensures that web requests are routed to the appropriate controllers and actions within the MVC framework.

For an in-depth understanding of the underlying concepts and capabilities, explore the Phalcon documentation:

- [Phalcon CLI Dispatcher](https://docs.phalcon.io/latest/application-cli/#dispatcher){:target="_blank"} for CLI
  applications.
- [Phalcon MVC Dispatcher](https://docs.phalcon.io/latest/dispatcher/){:target="_blank"} for MVC web applications.

!!! warning "Parameter Handling in Phalcon"
    In Phalcon, all parameters defined in the router are passed to the action method of the dispatcher's handler. This
    behavior, however, can be unstable, particularly when dealing with parameters that have mixed integer and string keys.
    The issue arises from the potential mixing of parameter order, which can render the method parameters unreliable in
    various scenarios and use cases.

!!! danger "Zemit's Approach to Parameter Passing"
    To ensure stability and predictability in handling method parameters, Zemit modifies this behavior. Only parameters with
    integer keys are passed to the action method parameters in Zemit's dispatcher. This approach mitigates the risk of
    parameter order mix-up, enhancing the reliability of your application's routing and parameter handling mechanisms.

### Dispatching Process

At its core, dispatching in an MVC application, as facilitated by `\Phalcon\Mvc\Dispatcher`, involves several key steps:

1. **Receiving the Request**: The dispatcher receives the request object from the router.
2. **Extracting Information**: It extracts vital details such as the module name, controller name, action name, and any
   optional parameters.
3. **Controller Instantiation**: The corresponding controller is instantiated based on the extracted information.
4. **Action Execution**: The designated action within the controller is executed, handling the request as intended.

Zemit's Dispatcher enhances this process by integrating it seamlessly with the framework's architecture, ensuring
efficient and effective handling of both web and CLI requests.

## Benefits and Features

By extending Phalcon's native dispatchers, Zemit inherits all the flexibility, performance, and features of the Phalcon
framework while adding significant enhancements:

### Cyclic Routing Prevention

A common issue in dispatching is "_Dispatcher has detected a cyclic routing causing
stability problems._" This happens when there's an endless forwarding loop in the application. Zemit's Dispatcher can
automatically detect and prevent such single-hop cyclic routing issues, enhancing application stability. However, it's
important to note that it doesn’t resolve multiple-hop cycling issues, as these often involve complex scenarios that
require developer intervention.

### Business Rule Implementation in Zemit Dispatcher

The Zemit Dispatcher Service Provider is designed to automate and handle several vital aspects of application management
and routing. This configuration not only streamlines the development process but also ensures consistent and secure
application behavior across different environments. Here's a breakdown of the key business rules automatically managed
by the Zemit Dispatcher:

- **CORS and Preflight Requests**: The dispatcher is equipped to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and
  preflight requests, ensuring that your application can safely interact with resources from different domains as per
  your configuration.

- **Security and ACL Integration**: Security is a top priority, and the dispatcher seamlessly integrates with Access
  Control Lists (ACLs). This integration allows fine-grained control over access to different parts of your application,
  ensuring that users can only interact with resources they have permissions for.

- **Maintenance Mode Handling**: During periods of maintenance or updates, the dispatcher can engage a maintenance mode
  flag. This feature is crucial for informing users about ongoing maintenance while preventing access to the
  application's core functionalities.

- **Dispatch and Forwarding Logging**: Keeping track of dispatch processes and forward requests is essential for
  debugging and monitoring. The dispatcher logs these events, providing valuable insights into the application's routing
  behavior and performance.

- **Support for HMVC Architecture**: Zemit's dispatcher supports forwarding in multi-module architectures, making it
  ideal for applications following a Hierarchical Model-View-Controller (HMVC) pattern. This capability allows modules
  to request actions from other modules, fostering a highly modular and flexible application structure.

- **Dual Dispatching for CLI and MVC**: Recognizing the distinct needs of CLI and MVC environments, the dispatcher is
  equipped for dual dispatching. This means it can handle requests from both command-line interfaces and web
  environments, ensuring comprehensive application coverage.

- **Modular Architecture with Default Namespace Settings**: The dispatcher aids in implementing a modular architecture
  by allowing default namespace settings. This feature streamlines the organization of controllers and models within
  various modules, enhancing the structure and readability of the codebase.

The Zemit Dispatcher's automated approach to managing crucial business rules significantly enhances the application's
architecture on multiple fronts:

- **Simplified Development**: By automating complex processes like CORS handling, security enforcement, and maintenance
  mode management, the Dispatcher streamlines the development workflow. Developers can focus on core functionalities
  rather than getting bogged down by routine tasks.

- **Enhanced Security and Stability**: With integrated ACL support and meticulous logging of dispatch and forwarding
  actions, the Dispatcher strengthens the application’s security framework and stability. This proactive approach to
  application security ensures robust protection against common security threats.

- **Flexibility and Modularity**: The support for HMVC patterns and dual dispatching capabilities empowers developers to
  build highly modular and flexible applications. This adaptability is crucial for maintaining an organized and scalable
  codebase, especially in complex, multi-module projects.

- **Efficiency in Routing**: The Dispatcher's ability to handle and streamline routing for both web and CLI requests
  reduces overhead and enhances efficiency. This efficiency is particularly beneficial in applications with complex
  routing needs, where minimizing performance bottlenecks is crucial.

Incorporating these advanced features, Zemit’s Dispatcher not only makes request handling more efficient but also plays
a vital role in reducing the complexity typically associated with routing and dispatching in web applications.
Developers leveraging Zemit can expect a more intuitive, secure, and manageable routing process, enabling them to build
sophisticated web solutions with ease.
