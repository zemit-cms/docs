# Response Component

## Introduction

Zemit's Response HTTP Component, `Zemit\Http\Response`, extends the functionality of `\Phalcon\Http\Response`, offering a sophisticated way to construct and deliver HTTP responses to users. This extension enriches the capabilities of the Phalcon Response component, ensuring that responses are tailored to the specific needs of your Zemit application.

## Core Functionalities

`Zemit\Http\Response` serves as the constructor and manager of HTTP responses in your application. It encapsulates all aspects of the HTTP response, including headers, content, and status codes. The component provides a versatile set of tools to build a response, whether itâ€™s setting headers, determining the content type, or managing cookies.

- **Response Construction**: Allows for setting various parts of the HTTP response, such as content, status codes, and headers. This is essential for controlling how your application communicates its results and status to clients.

- **Header Management**: Facilitates easy manipulation of response headers, crucial for directing browser behavior, handling cookies, and managing caching.

- **Content Handling**: Provides methods to set different types of content, including JSON, HTML, and plain text, offering flexibility in how information is returned to the client.

- **Status Code Control**: Enables setting of HTTP status codes, allowing your application to convey the correct semantic meaning about each response (e.g., success, error, redirection).

### Extending Phalcon's Capabilities
By extending `\Phalcon\Http\Response`, Zemit inherits and enhances the comprehensive response handling features offered by Phalcon. This includes additional functionalities that might be specific to Zemit, such as custom headers or content processing relevant to the application's architecture or business logic.

Utilizing `Zemit\Http\Response`, developers gain a powerful tool to construct and deliver HTTP responses in a way that is both intuitive and aligned with their application's specific requirements. This component is integral to the efficient operation of Zemit applications, ensuring a seamless and controlled interaction between the server and the client.
