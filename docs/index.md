# Welcome to Zemit

Welcome to the documentation for Zemit, a framework built on top of Phalcon PHP that simplifies the usage of Phalcon and
allows for consistent, standard coding across multiple projects. With Zemit, you can take advantage of shared features
and avoid having to recreate the same code in different projects.

This documentation will guide you through the various components and features of Zemit Core, helping you get up and
running with the framework quickly and easily.
